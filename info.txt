Register mouse event handlers on the panel.
In each handler print the event type and
and mouse pointer coordinates. Notify when dragging
by checking if the mouse button is held down
during the mouse move event. It is not possible to
see the click event firing because the mouse up
event fires immediately after and overwrites
the click notification.
